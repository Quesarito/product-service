# Anazom E-Commerce Product Details Microservice

Anazom's Product Details Microservice is the frontend component that renders details about a specific product sold by Anazom. Built on top of React.js, it uses React's "virtual DOM" to modify state, and makes API queries to the /product API. 

There are myriad event handlers that display both textual, numerical and visual data to the user, both static and dynamic. There are reviews ratings numerical values, several animations, magnification functions, etc. in the product details component.
